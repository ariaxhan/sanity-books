This book is one of those stories that I would have never thought of myself. I love the way it handles social media culture and beauty standards, showing a potential, chilling scenario rather than lecturing.

This is a very dark take on the whole "kids with powers living in a facility" trope.
</br> </br> It reminds me of Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children, but with a lot more violence. 
</br> </br>It also bore many similarities to one of my favorite childhood books, The Mysterious Benedict Society.
